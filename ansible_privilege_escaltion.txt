Ansible Privilege escalation setup

On Controller Node
Create a one user named as jenkins1 don't give any power just create one user in it

On Managed Node
Create a one user as ubuntu give as complete power by entry in /etc/sudoers file

ubuntu ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

go to controller Node once again 
create ansible.cfg file in jenkins1 user
vi ansible.cfg
[defaults]
host_key_checking=false
inventory=/home/jenkins1/hosts

Now create hosts file in location /home/jenkins/hosts
<Managed_NODE_IP> ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_pass=123

Now run following command
-> ansible all -m ping 
   You find it sucess

But as same time
-> ansible all -m command -a 'cat /etc/shadow'
   It showed permission denied
   for this you need to pass one argument
-> ansible all -m command -a 'cat /etc/shadow' --become
   -- become act like as sudo cat /etc/shadow

Now this setup done

Now if created playbook so for running playbook you also need to pass this argument 
--become

There are 3 more arguments which you should know
--become-method=sudo By default it is sudo . But in market there are differnet type of
                privilege escalation methods are avaialable
--become-user=root By default it is root. But if you want another user power you can
              specify it
--become-ask-pass=false 

all these arguments you can pass to ansible.cfg file


[privilege_escalation]
become=true
become_method=sudo
become_user=root
become_ask_pass=false



Now run playbook 
ansible-playbook test.yml

It will run sucessfully


Now password less mechanism 

ssh-keygen in controller node 
it will create two files in .ssh
one is private key one is public key file 
private key extension would be id_rsa and public key would be id_rsa.pub

Now you need to copy these public key to Managed node by
ssh-copy-id ubuntu@192.168.99.105 


On Managed Node it will create one folder.ssh/ and one file in it authorized_keys
and inside this file our public key is there
